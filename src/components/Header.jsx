            After my vocational training as an industrial clerk at a large
            German automotive supplier I started studying Information Systems.
            Since completing my masters degree, I have been working as a
            research assistant at the University of WÃ¼rzburg where I am also a
            Phd candidate. My passion is to analyze data and to visualize my
            results. Please check out my projects below!
